I am Hiroyuki Yamada, CTO and co-CEO of [Scalar, Inc.](https://www.scalar-labs.com/)
I am the original creator of [ScalarDB](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb), universal HTAP engine for diverse databases, and [ScalarDL](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardl), Byzantine-fault detection middleware for transactional databases.
I am passionate about database systems and distributed systems, especially making transactions and query processing highly scalable and available.
I received my Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo, where I worked on parallel database systems under the supervision of Prof. Masaru Kitsuregawa.
